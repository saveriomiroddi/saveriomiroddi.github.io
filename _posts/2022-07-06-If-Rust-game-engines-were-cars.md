(While this article is humorous, and a bit snarky, it points out what I believe are significant issues in the Rust game development ecosystem. I'm following up with a serious article which describes my experience and my related opinions. Until then, this article should be taken just as a silly, humorous, piece)

Foo goes to a car dealer, in order to purchase a car.

\- This car is amazing... no wonder everybody wants one!<br/>
\- Yes, Sir! It's taken the world by storm; nobody wants other cars anymore.<br/>
\- Perfect, I'm sold! Here's my credit card.<br/>
\- (The dealer closes the sale, then hands the manual) Here's the manual.<br/>
\- Huh? It's... a blank piece of paper... (squints)... wait, there's something small here... it says... "a car"... "is a metallic box with an engine"<br/>
\- (Enthusiastically) That's all you need to know, Sir!<br/>
\- ... uh?<br/>
\- (Frowns) Well Sir, if you're such a bookworm, there's some guy around the corner who writes that kind of stuff.<br/>
\- Ok.<br/>
\- ... and if you want to learn advanced topics, like accelerating, that guy provides a reference to another guy...<br/>
\- Makes sense.<br/>
\- ... and we have a hotline.<br/>
\- (Happy) Well, as you said... "That's all I need!". Wait a second, though... (mumbles)... there's something else here... "not all the accessories are provided"<br/>
\- Certainly, Sir! In order to produce the most advanced car in the world, we don't waste time on useless accessories. But clients can fit them on their own, if they wish!<br/>
\- Well, it's accessories, anyway... Awesome! Bye!<br/>
\- Goodbye Sir, enjoy your new car!<br/>

Some time after, a friend of Foo, Bar, comes to see him from another country.

\- Hey man! I've heard you've purchased a Lambeviny... you lucky bastard!<br/>
\- Yeah! I'm super excited!!<br/>
\- Why don't you take me for a ride?<br/>
\- Well... it has a small... usability problem.<br/>
\- Which is?<br/>
\- It's missing two wheels.<br/>
\- WAT!!<br/>
\- Yeah, they don't produce such accessories.<br/>
\- WAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!! But... how do you drive it?<br/>
\- I've called some experts to have a look at the car! They said that the car is brilliant!<br/>
\- Uh... and did they fix it?<br/>
\- Fix it? Why should I fix it?<br/>
\- The wheels... you can't drive without them.<br/>
\- Driving? Who cares about driving? Cars are for modding, man!! Nobody drives cars. Some crazy people drive them in the village across the river, but they're really weird - they look like blocky. Anyway, I'm taking care of the problem, don't worry...<br/>
\- Phew! You had me for a moment.<br/>
\- ... I'm modding the steering wheel!<br/>

Bar goes back to his segfaults.
