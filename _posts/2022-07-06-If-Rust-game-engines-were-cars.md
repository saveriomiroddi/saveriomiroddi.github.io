title: "If Rust game engines were cars"

(This summarizes closely my experience with developing games with Rust game libraries, primarily with Bevy (those who have experience with building complete (even small, but still complete) games with it, probably know which functionality the "two missing wheels" represents))

Foo goes to a car dealer, in order to purchase a car.

\- This car is amazing... no wonder everybody wants one!<br/>
\- Yes, Sir! It's taken the world by storm; nobody wants other cars anymore.<br/>
\- Perfect, I'm sold! Here's my credit card.<br/>
\- (The dealer closes the sale, then hands the manual) Here's the manual.<br/>
\- Huh? It's... a blank piece of paper... (squints)... wait, there's something small here... it says... "a car"... "is a metallic box with an engine"<br/>
\- (Enthusiastically) That's all you need to know, Sir!<br/>
\- ... uh?<br/>
\- (Frowns) Well Sir, if you're such a bookworm, there's some guy around the corner who writes that kind of stuff.<br/>
\- Ok.<br/>
\- ... and if you want to learn advanced topics, like accelerating, that guy provides a reference to another guy...<br/>
\- Makes sense.<br/>
\- ... and we have a hotline.<br/>
\- (Happy) Well, as you said... "That's all I need!". Wait a second, though... (mumbles)... there's something else here... "not all the accessories are provided"<br/>
\- Certainly, Sir! In order to produce the most advanced car in the world, we don't waste time on useless accessories. But clients can fit them on their own, if they wish!<br/>
\- Well, it's accessories, anyway... Awesome! Bye!<br/>
\- Goodbye Sir, enjoy your new car!<br/>

Some time after, a friend of Foo, Bar, comes to see him from another country.

\- Hey man! I've heard you've purchased a Lambeviny... you lucky bastard!<br/>
\- Yeah! I'm super excited!!<br/>
\- Why don't you take me for a ride?<br/>
\- Well... it has a small... usability problem.<br/>
\- Which is?<br/>
\- It's missing two wheels.<br/>
\- WAT!!<br/>
\- Yeah, they don't produce such accessories.<br/>
\- WAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!! But... how do you drive it?<br/>
\- I've called some experts to have a look at the car! They said that the car is brilliant!<br/>
\- Uh... and did they fix it?<br/>
\- Fix it? Why should I fix it?<br/>
\- The wheels... you can't drive without them.<br/>
\- Driving? Who cares about driving? Cars are for modding, man!! Nobody drives cars. Some crazy people drive them in the village across the river, but they're really weird - they look like blocky. Anyway, I'm taking care of the problem, don't worry...<br/>
\- Phew! You had me for a moment.<br/>
\- ... I'm modding the steering wheel!<br/>

Bar goes back to his segfaults.
