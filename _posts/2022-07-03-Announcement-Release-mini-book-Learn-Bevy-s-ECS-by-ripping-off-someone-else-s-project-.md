I've recently released my mini-book "Learn Bevy's ECS by ripping off someone else's project"; it's a mini-book that uses the game Rusty Roguelike from the book [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust) as a base, in order to explain Bevy's ECS.

The idea is for a beginner to learn ECS concepts from the base book, then apply them using Bevy; the structure of the game is ideal for a gentle introduction to ECS architecture.
