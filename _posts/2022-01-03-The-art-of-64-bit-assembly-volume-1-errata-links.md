I've recently completed the fantastic book "The Art of 64-Bit Assembly, Volume 1" (Randall Hyde, No Starch Press).

Since the errata of this book is hard to find, I'm posting here the link(s), in the hope that it gets more visible to the search engines.

The current errata discussions are in the [book board](https://randallhyde.com/Forum/viewforum.php?f=27) of Randall Hyde's forum. 

The dicussion "Errata Table 2-9" contains several errata; other errata are reported in self-standing threads. I've contributed two 🙂

There isn't anything particularly confusing, except one erratum (the subtraction/carry one).

Happy assembling 😁
