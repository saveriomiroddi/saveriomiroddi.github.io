I've recently completed the fantastic book "The Art of 64-Bit Assembly, Volume 1" (Randall Hyde, No Starch Press).

Since the errata of this book is hard to find, I'm posting here the link(s), in the hope that it gets more visible to the search engines.

The current errata discussions are in the [book board](https://randallhyde.com/Forum/viewforum.php?f=27) of Randall Hyde's forum:

- [Errata Table 2-9](https://randallhyde.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=66)
- [Errata: Pointers](https://randallhyde.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=116)

The first dicussion contains several errata; I've contributed with one.

There isn't anything particularly confusing, except one (the subtraction/carry one).

Happy assembling üòÅ
