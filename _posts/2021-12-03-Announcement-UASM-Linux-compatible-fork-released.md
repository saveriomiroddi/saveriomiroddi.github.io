title: Announcement&#58; UASM Linux-compatible fork released
tags: [announcement,assembler,linux]
---

The book [The Art of 64-Bit Assembly](https://nostarch.com/art-64-bit-assembly) has been recently released.

The book is an update in the series "The Art of Assembly Language"; while very popular, it has a problem: it's based on the MASM assembler, which is tied to the Windows platform.

MASM has a multiplatform fork called UASM, however, it hasn't been possible to build the project on Linux for a long time now.

I've therefore created a fork with all the fixes required to build it on Linux; this will hopefully be useful to people who, like me, are studying the book using a Linux system.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/64kramsystem/uasm-linux).
