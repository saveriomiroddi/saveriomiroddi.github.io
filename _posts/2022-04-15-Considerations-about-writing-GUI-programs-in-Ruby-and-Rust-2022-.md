Around four years ago, I wrote an article about [writing GUI programs in Ruby]({% post_url 2018-03-13-An-overview-of-ruby-gui-development-in-2018 %}); recently, I needed a new program/functionality, very similar to the one that originally prompted me to write the article.

Since in the meanwhile I've learned Rust, now I could not only opt for multiple frameworks, but also two languages, with radically different philosophies.

In this article I'll expose my considerations about the two languages, in particular - but not exclusively - in the context of GUI progamming.
