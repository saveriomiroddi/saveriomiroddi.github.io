description: A very fun book on game programming - but surprisingly, a very poor one. The book doesn&#39;t hold its premises&#58; there&#39;s nothing from gurus (I presume he refers himself as such) because the level is (intentionally) basic, and the project (Warlock) is not a game but a renderer; additionally, by examining both 2d and 3d, it ends up being somewhat disjointed and sparse.
